This library is a port of [google/gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
written in PHP.  Its purpose is to easily handle the conversion
between PHP objects and JSON.  It shares some of google/gson's goals
such as:

* A simple interface using `toJson` and `fromJson` methods
* Enable serialization and deserialization of 3rd party classes
* Allow schema differences between PHP objects and JSON

And in addition:

* Utilize PHP 7 scalar type hints to be intelligent about property types
* Limit the number of annotations required to use
* Allow serialization decisions based on runtime information

Overview
--------

Here are some simple use cases to get a feel for how the library works

If you have a PHP object you want to convert to JSON

```php
// $object obtained elsewhere

$gson = Gson::builder()->build();
$json = $gson->toJson($object);
```

What this is doing is using the provided `GsonBuilder` to set up the
`Gson` object with sensible defaults.  Calling `Gson::toJson` and
passing in an object will return a string of JSON.

The reverse is very similar

```php
// $json obtained elsewhere

$gson = Gson::builder()->build();
$fooObject = $gson->fromJson($json, Foo::class);
```

Now we call `Gson::fromJson` and pass in the json as a string and the type
of object we'd like to map to.  In this example, we will be getting
an instantiated `Foo` object back.

If you want to convert your object to a [JsonElement](docs/JsonElement.md),
there's a convenience method to do that for you.

```php
// $object obtained elsewhere

$gson = Gson::builder()->build();
$jsonElement = $gson->toJsonElement($object);
```

This provides a simple way to manipulate the JSON before final encoding.
From here, you can call `json_encode()` on the element to convert it to
JSON.

```php
$jsonElement = $gson->toJsonElement($object);
$jsonElement->asObject()->addString('foo', 'bar');
$json = json_encode($jsonElement);
```

Note that this will do a full conversion from the object to JSON, then
back to JsonElements.  This is done to take advantage of all custom
serialization rules.

Likewise, there are methods to operate on arrays instead of strings of json

```php
// $object obtained elsewhere

$gson = Gson::builder()->build();
$jsonArray = $gson->toArray($object);
$object = $gson->fromArray($jsonArray);
```

Installation
------------

This library requires PHP 7.1

```bash
composer require tebru/gson-php
```

Be sure and set up the annotation loader in one of your initial scripts.

```
\Doctrine\Common\Annotations\AnnotationRegistry::registerLoader('class_exists');
```
